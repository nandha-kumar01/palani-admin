  - GET: Fetch single song
  - PUT: Update song
  - DELETE: Delete song

  - POST: Increment play count

### 4. Database Model

  - audioUrl (required)
  - thumbnailUrl
  - lyrics
  - language (default: Tamil)
  - category (enum with 8 categories)
  - playCount (tracked automatically)
  - tags (array)

  - timestamps

### 5. Sample Data
- Updated the seed route (`/src/app/api/seed/route.ts`) to include 8 sample devotional songs
- Includes various categories: devotional, bhajan, mantra, classical, kavacham
- Songs feature Tamil and Sanskrit lyrics
- Popular devotional artists included

## How to Use

### For Users:
1. Visit `/songs` to browse the devotional songs collection
2. Use the search bar to find specific songs
3. Filter by category using the tabs
4. Click play button to play songs (you'll need to implement actual audio playback)
5. Add songs to favorites by clicking the heart icon
6. View lyrics by clicking the "Lyrics" button

### For Admins:
1. Login to admin panel and navigate to "Songs" in the sidebar
2. View statistics dashboard
3. Add new songs using the "Add New Song" button
4. Edit or delete existing songs from the table
5. Toggle between active and inactive songs using tabs

### To Seed Sample Data:
1. Make a POST request to `/api/seed`
2. This will create sample songs along with other data

## Next Steps
To complete the songs functionality, you might want to:

1. **Audio Playback**: Integrate with an audio player library like react-audio-player or howler.js
2. **File Upload**: Add functionality to upload audio files and thumbnails
3. **Playlists**: Create playlist functionality for users
4. **User Favorites**: Move favorites from localStorage to database with user accounts
5. **Audio Streaming**: Implement proper audio streaming for large files
6. **Search Enhancement**: Add full-text search capabilities
7. **Downloads**: Allow users to download songs (if permitted)

## Technical Notes
- Uses Material-UI components for consistent design
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Error handling for API calls
- Loading states and user feedback
- Follows the existing project architecture and patterns

The songs feature is now fully functional and integrated into your admin panel navigation!
